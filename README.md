The goal of `rimgtool` is to perform image processing in R.

## Package Overview

`rimgtool` is a R package that is intended to allow users to compress,
sharpen and crop an input image. Our package only allows the input image
to be a 3D vector and output the manipulated image as a 3D numpy
array. It contains three functions: `compress()`, `sharpen()`, and
`crop()`.

## Feature Description

  - `compress`:
      - This function quantizes an image by restricting each pixel to
        only take on one of the desired colour values and return a
        version of the image (the same size as the original) where each
        pixelâ€™s original colour is replaced with the nearest prototype
        colour.
  - `sharpen`:
      - This function enhances the edges in the image and returns a
        sharper-looking image. At this moment, this function is
        restricted to gray-scale images only
  - `crop`:
      - A function that removes border pixels for image croping until
        the desired width and height are reached.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/rimgtool")
```

## Related Packages

There are a few existing R packages that perform image manipulation such
as
[magick](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html)
and
[imager](https://dahtah.github.io/imager/imager.html#resizing-rotation-etc.),
which could be used for simplifying high-quantity images. However, these
packages are usually very comprehensive and provide many functions to
process the image in different ways. There are very few smaller packages
available on Github to perform simpler image processing tasks like image
croping such as [this package](https://github.com/vgorte/SC-Package-R)
using seam carving mechanism. Our implementation of image processing is
a less sophisticated version of the existing image processing tools, we
focus specifically on image compression, croping, and sharpening using
simpler and easy to understand
algorithms.

## Usage

| Task                                                  | After import `rimgtool`        |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Compress an image to include 2^4 = 16 colors          | `rimgtool.compress(image, 4L)`  |
| Sharpen an image by detecting and enhancing the edges | `rimgtool.sharpen(image)`      |
| crop an image to desired width and height             | `rimgtool.crop(image, 20, 20)` |

## Usage scenario

First, we should load the `rimgtool` library:

`library(rimgtool)`

We are going to use `butterfly.jpg` image which is in the `img` folder of this repository for illustration.

![](img/butterfly.jpg)

We can apply the compress function:
`compress(image, 4L)`

```
library(jpeg) # install.packages('jpeg')
library(OpenImageR) # install.packages('OpenImageR')
img <- jpeg::readJPEG("img/butterfly.jpg")
jpeg::writeJPEG(compress(img, 4L), target = 'img/compress.jpeg')

```
![](img/compress.jpeg)


We can also apply the crop function:

`crop(img, 400, 400)`


```
jpeg::writeJPEG(crop(img, 400, 400), target = 'img/crop.jpeg')
```

![](img/crop.jpeg)

We can also apply the sharpen function:
`sharpen(image)`

```R
# install.packages('jpeg')
library(jpeg)
img <- jpeg::readJPEG("img/free-wallpaper.jpg")
jpeg::writeJPEG(sharpen(img), target = 'img/sharpened.jpeg')
```

<img src="img/sharpen_before.png" data-canonical-src="img/sharpen_before.png" width="400" height="300" />  <img src="img/sharpen_after.png" data-canonical-src="img/sharpen_after.png" width="400" height="300" />

  - `sharpen` can be used to enhance the edges in a picture so that the
    details can stand out. Displayed above, the photo on the left-hand
    side is before sharpening, and the photo on the right-hand side is
    after sharpening. As the details are enhanced by our sharpening
    function, the center portion of the flower look more focused.
