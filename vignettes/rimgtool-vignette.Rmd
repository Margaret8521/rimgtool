# Introduction to rimgtool

This package provides three functions:
- sharpen
- compress
- crop

As the name suggests, we aim to providing some tools for easy image processing.  To use this package, follow the installation guide on README and install this package.  Then, import the package.

## Package Overview

`rimgtool` is a R package that is intended to allow users to compress,
sharpen and crop an input image. Our package only allows the input image
to be a 3D numpy array and output the manipulated image as a 3D numpy
array. It contains three functions: `compress()`, `sharpen()`, and
`crop()`.

## Feature Description

  - `compress`:
      - This function quantizes an image by restricting each pixel to
        only take on one of the desired colour values and return a
        version of the image (the same size as the original) where each
        pixelâ€™s original colour is replaced with the nearest prototype
        colour.
  - `sharpen`:
      - This function enhances the edges in the image and returns a
        sharper-looking image. At this moment, this function is
        restricted to gray-scale images only
  - `crop`:
      - A function that removes border pixels for image croping until
        the desired width and height are reached.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r 1.1}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/rimgtool")
```

Then, import this package in R console:

```{r 1.2 setup}
library(rimgtool)
```

### `Shrpen` function

The purpose of this function is to detect and enhance the edges in a grey-scale image using a 2-D convolution so that the details can stand out. Displayed BELOW, the photo on the left-hand side is before sharpening, and the photo on the right-hand side is after sharpening. As the details are enhanced by our sharpening function, the center portion of the flower look more focused.

Apply `sharpen` function: `sharpen(img)`

```
# install.packages('jpeg')
library(jpeg)
img <- jpeg::readJPEG("img/free-wallpaper.jpg")
jpeg::writeJPEG(sharpen(img), target = 'img/sharpened.jpeg')
```

<img src="../img/sharpen_before.png" data-canonical-src="img/sharpen_before.png" width="600" height="450" />  <img src="../img/sharpen_after.png" data-canonical-src="img/sharpen_after.png" width="600" height="450" />

### `Compress` function

We are going to use `butterfly.jpg` image which is in the `img` folder of this repository for illustration.

![](../img/butterfly.jpg)

We can apply the compress function:
`compress(image, 4)`

```
library(jpeg) # install.packages('jpeg')
library(OpenImageR) # install.packages('OpenImageR')
img <- jpeg::readJPEG("img/butterfly.jpg")
jpeg::writeJPEG(compress(img, 4L), target = 'img/compress.jpeg')

```
![](../img/compress.jpeg)

### `Crop` function

We can also apply the crop function:

`crop(img, 400, 400)`

```
jpeg::writeJPEG(crop(img, 400, 400), target = 'img/crop.jpeg')
```

![](../img/crop.jpeg)
